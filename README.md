This Prework Study Guide can be used to review information we have learned on HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript.  Each section is organized in it's own text area.  If you open the DevTools Console menu, you can see JavaScript running.  It will list the topics learned from prework, and choose a topic for us to study first.
